This second case was designed to examine token sequences which repeat in
multiple locations in a file.

For example this sequence repeats in this file for the first time. We
create a small distraction by adding some text between the matching
sequences that would not match.
Next, we see this sequence repeats in this file again and that this file
which has a second repeating sequence here.
Finally, to conclude our experiment this sequence repeats in this file
which has a second repeating sequence here one last time.
